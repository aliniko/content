Polymorphism is the presentation of one interface for multiple data types.
or Polymorphism is a word derived from the Greek language meaning "multiple forms". An alternative translation might be: "something that can take on many shapes".

So, to understand what polymorphism is about, let's consider some real-life objects.

A door has a bell. It could be said that the bell is a property of the door object. This bell can be rung. When would someone ring a bell on the door? Obviously, to get someone to show up at the door.

Now consider a bell on a bicycle. A bicycle has a bell. It could be said that the bell is a property of the bicycle object. This bell could also be rung. However, the reason, the intention, and the result of somebody ringing the bell on a bicycle is not the same as ringing the bell on a door.


For example, integers, floats, and doubles are implicitly polymorphic: regardless of their different types, they can all be added, subtracted, multiplied, and so on.

In the case of {{glossary("OOP")}}, by making the {{glossary("class")}} responsible for its code as well as its own data, polymorphism can be achieved in that each class has its own {{glossary("function")}} that (once called) behaves properly for any {{glossary("object")}}.
